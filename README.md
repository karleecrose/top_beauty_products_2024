# top_beauty_products_2024
This project explores a dataset of 15,000 beauty and cosmetic products to uncover actionable insights for consumer behavior and market trends. Using Python and Pandas, I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns in product usage, pricing, ratings, and brand performance.

Key findings include:
Daily-use products such as concealer, serum, mascara, lipstick, and lip liner are the most dominant, making them ideal for new brand launches.
Cruelty-free products tend to have comparable ratings to non-cruelty-free products, offering insight for ethical branding strategies.
Heatmaps reveal which brands perform best across different product categories, with clear ombre visualizations for storytelling.
Usage frequency trends vary significantly by category, helping identify high-engagement product lines.
This analysis is useful for aspiring beauty entrepreneurs, product developers, and marketing strategists seeking to understand the competitive landscape and consumer priorities in the cosmetics industry.
